# STATUS

Stage: Prototype
Now: init/status/workspace commands; context init/list/mount/validate/discover/ensure-all; graph export; minimal config + plugin discovery; service + orchestrator skeletons; render-only launchd/systemd adapters; pytest coverage for core modules; studio sources in apps/studio.
Not yet: service adapters that install/start services; full orchestration pipeline; TUI.
Next: improve orchestrator routing heuristics; add TUI starter screen.
Issues: service runtime not wired to system services.
